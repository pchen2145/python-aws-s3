## This repository contains the following:
+ A python module defining basic functions which can be called to perform S3 related tasks on AWS. Examples of tasks include creating buckets, deleting buckets, listing objects within buckets, and uploading objects to buckets
+ A yaml config file that contains a list of bucketnames and objects within those buckets
## Prerequisites
+ AWS python boto3 SDK installed on your local machine
+ An AWS account with pre-configured secret and private access keys. This will allow you to make S3 API calls to boto3 from the CLI
#### The purpose of this repository is to share some of the basic tasks that can be performed on S3 using python scripts, allowing for automation of repetitive tasks that would normally be managed through the AWS Console. Walking through this exercise can give you a better understanding of the boto3 client and service resource hierarchies, as well as how to parse data from a yaml file into json which is the preferred input for many AWS services.


## Questions comments or updates can be left below. Enjoy!
